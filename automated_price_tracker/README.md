# Automated Price tracker (Work In Progress)

In this project I have build an app, that would get the total availabile seats and ticket price of a train for a particular day, everyday.\
I have used `Python scipt`, `Selenium webdriver`, `mac automator app` and `mac calendar app` for this purpose.

# Steps
1. [Create a python script to scrape a website for information](#step-1)
2. [Use mac's automator app to build an application that would take input from the user, run the python script (created in step 1) based on this user input and display the details as a notification](#step-2)
3. [Integrate the app (created in step 2) with mac's calendar app to run it everyday](#step-3)
