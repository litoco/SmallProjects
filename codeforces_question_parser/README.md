# Codeforces questions parser 
In this project I have built a **selenium** application in **python** language. It gets input like:
1. ***contest type (global rounds, div.1 div.2 div3 div.4)***
2. ***questions difficulty (A, B, C, D, E)***
3. ***starting contest (after which you want to start searching for your contest type)***
4. ***number of questions (as integer, that you want get as an output)*** 

# Pre-requisite 
In order to run this application you should have **python** and **pip** installed on you local machine

# Steps
1. Run the `main.py` file with the appropriate input and wait for the output 
2. Done
